# PSDscResources

**PSDscResources** is the new home of the in-box resources from **PSDesiredStateConfiguration**. The
resources in this module are maintained and supported by Microsoft.

These resources are a combination of those in the in-box **PSDesiredStateConfiguration** module as
well as community contributions from our experimental [xPSDesiredStateConfiguration][1] module on
GitHub. These resources have also recently been updated to meet the DSC Resource Kit
[High Quality Resource Module (HQRM) guidelines][2].

In-box resources not included in this module shouldn't be affected and can still load from the
in-box **PSDesiredStateConfiguration** module.

Because **PSDscResources** overwrites in-box resources, it's only available for DSC 1.1 and
PowerShell 5.1 or later. Several of the resource updates provided here are also included in the
**xPSDesiredStateConfiguration** module, which is still compatible earlier versions (though this
module isn't supported and may be removed in the future).

To update your in-box resources to the newest versions provided by **PSDscResources**, first install
**PSDscResources** from the [PowerShell Gallery][3]:

```powershell
Install-Module PSDscResources
```

Then, add this line to your DSC configuration:

```powershell
Import-DscResource -ModuleName PSDscResources
```

### Resources that work on Nano Server

- [Group][9]
- [Script][13]
- [Service][14]
- [User][16]
- [WindowsOptionalFeature][19]
- [WindowsOptionalFeatureSet][20]
- [WindowsPackageCab][21]

### Resources that don't work in machine configuration

When using Azure Policy's machine configuration feature, don't use the following resources:

- `WindowsFeature`
- `WindowsFeatureSet`
- `WindowsOptionalFeature`
- `WindowsOptionalFeatureSet`
- `WindowsPackageCab`

There's a limitation in machine configuration that prevents a DSC Resource from using any PowerShell
cmdlets not included in PowerShell itself or in a module on the PowerShell Gallery. These DSC
Resources use cmdlets from one or more [Windows modules][24] and won't work in machine
configuration.
