- Target machine must have access to the **DISM** PowerShell module.
- Target machine must have access to the **ServerManager** PowerShell module.

## Properties

## Key properties

### Name

Specify the name of the role or feature as a string.

This value for this property should be the same as the **Name** property of the role or feature, not
the **DisplayName** property. To list the available roles and features for a computer, use the
`Get-WindowsFeature` cmdlet.

Specify whether the role or feature should be installed. Set this property to `Present` to install
the role or feature if it isn't installed. Set this property to `Absent` to uninstall the role or
feature if it's installed.

The default value is `Present`.

```
Type: System.String

The default value is `$false`.
