# Update a service's StartupType

## Description

This example shows how you can use the `Service` resource to ensure a service exists with the
correct startup type.

With **Ensure** set to `Present`, **Name** set to `Service1`, and **Path** not set, the resource
throws an exception if the service doesn't exist.

With **StartupType** set to `Manual`, the resource sets the startup type to `Manual` if the
`Service1` service exists and has any other startup type.

With **State** set to `Ignore`, the resource doesn't start or stop the `Service1` service.

## With Invoke-DscResource

This script shows how you can use the `Service` resource with the `Invoke-DscResource` cmdlet to
ensure the `Service1` service exists and has the `Manual` startup type.

## With a Configuration

This snippet shows how you can define a `Configuration` with a `Service` resource block to ensure
the `Service1` service exists and has the `Manual` startup type.
