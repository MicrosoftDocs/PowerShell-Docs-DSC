# Create a non-path environment variable

## Description

This example shows how you can use the `Environment` resource to ensure a non-path environment
variable exists with a specific value.

With **Ensure** set to `Present`, **Name** set to `TestEnvironmentVariable`, and **Value** set to
`TestValue`, the resource adds an environment variable called `TestEnvironmentVariable` with the
value `TestValue` if it doesn't exist.

With **Path** set to `$false`, if `TestEnvironmentVariable` exists with any value other than
`TestValue`, the resource sets it to exactly `TestValue`.

With **Target** set to an array with both `Process` and `Machine`, the resource creates or sets the
environment variable in both the process and machine targets.

## With Invoke-DscResource

This script shows how you can use the `Environment` resource with the `Invoke-DscResource` cmdlet to
ensure `TestEnvironmentVariable` is set in the process and machine targets as `TestValue`.

## With a Configuration

This snippet shows how you can define a `Configuration` with an `Environment` resource block to
ensure `TestEnvironmentVariable` is set in the process and machine targets as `TestValue`.
