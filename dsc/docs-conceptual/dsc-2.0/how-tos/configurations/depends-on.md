# Managing dependencies in DSC Configurations

> Applies To: PowerShell 7.2, Azure Policy's machine configuration feature

When you write [DSC Configurations][1] for [Azure Policy's machine configuration feature][2], you
add [Resource blocks][3] to configure aspects of a system. As you continue to add DSC Resource
blocks, your DSC Configurations can grow large and cumbersome to manage. One such challenge is the
applied order of your DSC Resource blocks. By default, DSC Resources are applied in the order
they're defined within the `Configuration` block. As your DSC Configuration grows larger and more
complex, you can use the **DependsOn** meta-property to change the applied order of your DSC
Resources by specifying that one DSC Resource depends on another DSC Resource.

The **DependsOn** meta-property can be used in any DSC Resource block. It's defined with the same
key/value mechanism as other DSC Resource properties. The **DependsOn** meta-property expects an
array of strings with the following syntax.

```text
DependsOn = '[<Resource Type>]<Resource Name>', '[<Resource Type>]<Resource Name>'
```

The following example configures a group's membership after creating a user.

```powershell
Configuration ConfigureExampleUserGroup {
    Import-DSCResource -Name User, Group -Module PSDscResources

    Group Example {
        GroupName = 'DscExampleGroup'
        Members   = 'DscExampleUser'
        DependsOn = '[User]Example'
    }

    User Example {
        UserName    = 'DscExampleUser'
        Ensure      = 'Present'
        Description = 'Example user who should be a member of DscExampleGroup.'
    }
}

ConfigureExampleUserGroup
```
