## [v3.0.0-alpha.5][release-v3.0.0-alpha.5] - 2024-02-27

This section includes a summary of changes for the `alpha.5` release. For the full list of changes
in this release, see the [diff on GitHub][compare-v3.0.0-alpha.5].

### Changed

- Updated the options for the `dsc` root command:

  - Removed the global `--format` option, which controls the output format. Now, the relevant
    subcommands that return formattable output have the `--format` option (short option as `-f`)
    added to them.
  - Removed the global `--input` and `--input-file` options. Now, the `config` subcommands have the
    `--document` and `--path` options for specifying the configuration document as a string or from
    a file. The relevant `resource` subcommands have the `--input` and `--path` options for
    specifying the instance properties as a string or from a file.
  - The `--logging-level` option is renamed to [--trace-level][36] with the short name `-l`. The
    default trace level is now `warning` instead of `info`.
  - Added the [--trace-format][37] option with the `-f` short name. This option enables you to
    choose the format for the trace messages emitted to stderr. By default, the messages are
    emitted as lines of text with console colors. You can set this option to `plaintext` to emit
    the messages without console colors or to `json` to emit the messages as JSON objects.

  </details>

- Updated the JSON schemas for the [get][38], [set][39], and [test][40] output data. This change
  corrects an issue with how DSC surfaced information about instances nested inside group and
  adapter resources. Now when you review the output, you'll be able to see the results for each
  nested instance instead of a confusing object that loses the nested instance type and name
  information.

  This schema change is backwards compatible.

  <details>

- Changed the [concat][41] configuration function to match the behavior of the ARM template
  function. The `concat()` function now only accepts strings or arrays of strings as input values.
  It raises an error if the input values aren't of the same type.

### Added

- Implemented support for referencing parameters in a configuration with the [parameters()][32]
  configuration function. This enables you to take advantage of parameterized configurations. Until
  this release, you could define but not reference parameters.

  Now, you can use the [--parameters][33] and [--parameters-file][34] options with the
  [dsc config][35] commands to pass values for any parameter defined in the configuration document.

  - PRs:
    - [#291][#291]
    - [#294][#294]

  </details>

- Added support for authoring DSC Resource manifests in YAML. DSC now recognizes resource manifests
  that use the `.dsc.resource.yml` or `.dsc.resource.yaml` file extension instead of only
  `.dsc.resource.json`.

  <details><summary>Related work Items</summary>

  - Issues: [#129][#129]
  - PRs: [#311][#311]

  </details>

- Added the [DSCConfigRoot][42] environment variable and the [envvar() configuration function][43]
  to enable users to reference files and folders relative to the folder containing the
  configuration document. DSC automatically creates the `DSCConfigRoot` environment variable when
  you use the `--path` option to specify the configuration document instead of passing the document
  as a string from stdin or with the `--document` option.

  > [!NOTE]
  > In this release, DSC doesn't expand the specified path to an absolute path. You should always
  > specify the full path to the configuration document if you want to reference the
  > `DSCConfigRoot` variable in your configuration. Further, DSC always sets the value for this
  > environment variable when you use the `--path` option. If the environment variable is already
  > set, it overrides it silently.
  >
  > In a future release, the variable will be renamed to `DSC_CONFIG_ROOT` and DSC will
  > automatically expand relative paths into absolute paths when setting the environment variable.
  > It will also emit a warning when it overrides the variable.

  - PRs: [#313][#313]

  </details>

- Added support for using the [dsc config export][44] and [dsc resource export][45] commands with
  the PowerShell adapter resource. PSDSC resources can now participate in the `export` command if
  they define a static method that returns an array of the PSDSC resource class.

  <details><summary>Related work Items</summary>

  - Issues: [#183][#183]
  - PRs: [#307][#307]

  </details>

- Added the `methods` column to the default table view for the console output of the
  [dsc resource list][46] command. This new column indicates which methods the resource explicitly
  implements. Valid values include `get`, `set`, `test`, and `export`. This information is only
  available in the table view. It isn't part of the output object for the command. If you use the
  [--format][47] parameter, capture the command output, or redirect the output, the `methods`
  information isn't included.

  Resources that don't implement `test` rely on DSC's synthetic test behavior instead. They can
  still be used for test and set operations.

  Resources that don't implement `export` can't be used with the `dsc config export` or
  `dsc resource export` commands.

  Resources that don't implement `set` can be used for auditing, but not `dsc resource set`. They
  can be used with the `dsc config set` command, but only if they're nested inside a
  `DSC/AssertionGroup` instance.

  </details>

- Added an prototype for a WMI resource adapter to enable users to query WMI. The adapter is
  disabled by default, as enumerating the WMI resources can have a performance impact. To enable
  it, rename the resource manifest from `wmigroup.dsc.resource.json.optout` to
  `wmigroup.dsc.resource.json`.

## [v3.0.0-alpha.4][release-v3.0.0-alpha.4] - 2023-11-14

This section includes a summary of changes for the `alpha.4` release. For the full list of changes
in this release, see the [diff on GitHub][compare-v3.0.0-alpha.4].

<!-- Release links -->
[release-v3.0.0-alpha.4]: https://github.com/PowerShell/DSC/releases/tag/v3.0.0-alpha.4 "Link to the DSC v3.0.0-alpha.4 release on GitHub"
[compare-v3.0.0-alpha.4]: https://github.com/PowerShell/DSC/compare/v3.0.0-alpha.3...v3.0.0-alpha.4

### Changed

- Updated the canonical version of the schema URIs from `2023/08` to `2023/10`, as this release
  includes breaking changes for the schemas.

  As part of this change, the `$schema` keyword for both [configuration documents][21] and
  [resource manifests][22] accepts any valid URI for the schemas, instead of only one. Now, you
  can set the value for the keyword to the unbundled schema, the bundled schema, or the enhanced
  authoring schema for any supported version.

- Replaced the `_ensure` well-known property with the boolean [_exist][23] property. This improves
  the semantics for users and simplifies implementation for resources, replacing the string enum
  values `Present` and `Absent` with `true` and `false` respectively.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues: [#202][#202]
  - PRs: [#206][#206]

  </details>

- Updated the `Microsoft.Windows/Registry` resource to use the `_exist` property instead of
  `_ensure` and updated the output to be idiomatic for a DSC Resource.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues: [#162][#162]
  - PRs: [#206][#206]

  </details>

- When a user presses the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> key combination, DSC now recursively
  terminates all child processes before exiting. This helps prevent dangling processes that were
  previously unhandled by the interrupt event.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - PRs: [#213][#213]

  </details>

### Added

- Added the `--input` and `--input-file` global options to the root `dsc` command. Now, you
  can pass input to DSC from a variable or file instead of piping from stdin.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues: [#130][#130]
  - PRs: [#217][#217]

  </details>

- Added the `arg` value as an option for defining how a command-based DSC Resource expects to
  receive input. This enables resource authors to define resources that handle DSC passing the
  instance JSON as an argument.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - PRs: [#213][#213]

  </details>

- Added the new [completer][26] command enables users to add shell completions for DSC to their
  shell. The command supports completions for Bash, Elvish, fish, PowerShell, and ZSH.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues: [#186][#186]
  - PRs: [#216][#216]

  </details>

- DSC now emits log messages to the stderr stream. This can make it easier to understand what DSC
  is doing. This doesn't affect the data output. By default, DSC emits errors, warnings, and
  informational messages, but not debug or trace messaging. You can control the level of the
  logging with the new `--logging-level` option on the root `dsc` command.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues:
    - [#107][#107]
    - [#158][#158]
  - PRs:
    - [#211][#211]
    - [#248][#248]

  </details>

- Added optimizations for the resource discovery process that runs before most `dsc` commands.
  These optimizations significantly reduce the command execution duration, especially for the
  `dsc resource *` commands, which rarely need to run a full discovery for resources.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues: [#173][#173]
  - PRs: [#240][#240]

  </details>

- Added initial [configuration document functions][28] to DSC. You can now use the [base64()][29],
  [concat()][30], and [resourceId()][31] functions in the configuration document.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The `resourceId` function has been reimplemented as a document function instead of a special
  > case, but it has the same functionality and parameters.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues: [#57][#57]
  - PRs:
    - [#241][#241]
    - [#252][#252]

  </details>

### Fixed

- The `--format` option now works as users expect when the output is redirected or saved to a
  variable. Before this fix, DSC always returned JSON output, even when the user wanted to save
  the output as YAML. With this fix, the specified format is respected.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - PRs: [#215][#215]

  </details>

- The `DSC/PowerShellGroup` resource now correctly returns the _labels_ for enumerations instead of
  their integer value, making it easier to understand and compare results.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues: [#159][#159]
  - PRs: [#208][#208]

  </details>

- DSC no longer terminates during discovery when a resource errors unless the erroring resource is
  being used for the command. DSC still terminates on a resource error during discovery under the
  following conditions:

  - When the erroring resource type is the same as the value of the `--resource` option for a
    `dsc resource *` command.
  - When an instance in the configuration document uses the erroring resource type for a
    `dsc config *` command.

  DSC emits the resource errors during discovery as warning messages for the `dsc resource list`
  command. In all other cases, DSC emits the errors as debug messages.

## [v3.0.0-alpha.3][release-v3.0.0-alpha.3] - 2023-09-26

This section includes a summary of changes for the `alpha.3` release. For the full list of changes
in this release, see the [diff on GitHub][compare-v3.0.0-alpha.3].

<!-- Release links -->
[release-v3.0.0-alpha.3]: https://github.com/PowerShell/DSC/releases/tag/v3.0.0-alpha.3 "Link to the DSC v3.0.0-alpha.3 release on GitHub"
[compare-v3.0.0-alpha.3]: https://github.com/PowerShell/DSC/compare/v3.0.0-alpha.2...v3.0.0-alpha.3

### Changed

- Replaced the `manifestVersion` property for resource manifests with [$schema][15]. Instead of
  specifying a semantic version, resources need to indicate which canonical schema DSC should use
  to validate and process the manifest.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues: [#127][#127]
  - PRs: [#199][#199]

  </details>

- Updated the `preTest` property for the `set` command in resource manifests to
  [implementsPretest][16] to more make the manifest easier to read and understand.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - PRs: [#197][#197]

  </details>

- The [dsc resource set][17] command no longer tests the resource instance before invoking the
  `set` operation. This simplifies the behavior for the command and adheres more accurately to the
  implied contract for directly invoking a resource with DSC.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues: [#98][#98]
  - PRs: [#197][#197]

  </details>

- Replaced the `args` option with `env` for defining how a command-based resource expects to
  receive input for the [get][18], [set][19], and [test][20] commands in the resource manifest.

  The `args` option was never implemented. Instead, resource authors can set the `input` property
  to `env` to indicate that the resource expects input as environmental variables.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - PRs: [#198][#198]

  </details>

- The `input` property for the [get][18] command in a resource manifest no longer has a default
  value. Instead, when a resource doesn't define `input` for the `get` command, DSC doesn't send
  any input to the resource for that command.

## [v3.0.0-alpha.2][release-v3.0.0-alpha.2] - 2023-09-05

This section includes a summary of changes for the `alpha.2` release. For the full list of changes
in this release, see the [diff on GitHub][compare-v3.0.0-alpha.2].

<!-- Release links -->
[release-v3.0.0-alpha.2]: https://github.com/PowerShell/DSC/releases/tag/v3.0.0-alpha.2 "Link to the DSC v3.0.0-alpha.2 release on GitHub"
[compare-v3.0.0-alpha.2]: https://github.com/PowerShell/DSC/compare/v3.0.0-alpha.1...v3.0.0-alpha.2

### Added

- Implemented functionality for the [dependsOn property of resource instances][01] in configuration
  documents, enabling resource instances to depend on the successful processing of one or more
  other instances in the document.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues: [#45][#45]
  - PRs: [#175][#175]

  </details>

- Added the [export][02] property to the resource manifest schema, indicating that the resource is
  exportable and defining how DSC can retrieve the current state for every instance of the
  resource.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues: [#73][#73]
  - PRs: [#171][#171]

  </details>

- Added the [dsc config export][03] command to convert an input configuration document defining a
  list of resource types into a usable configuration document that defines the current state for
  every instance of those resources.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues: [#73][#73]
  - PRs: [#171][#171]

  </details>

- Added the [dsc resource export][04] command to generate a usable configuration document that
  defines the current state for every instance of a specified resource.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues: [#73][#73]
  - PRs: [#171][#171]

  </details>

- Added the [--all][05] option for the [dsc resource get][06] command, enabling users to retrieve
  the current state for every instance of an exportable resource with a single command.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues:
    - [#73][#73]
    - [#174][#174]
  - PRs: [#171][#171]

  </details>

- Added handling for the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> key combination to cancel a DSC operation.
  When `dsc` cancels an operation due to this key-press, it indicates that the operation was
  cancelled with [exit code 6][07].

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - PRs: [#177][#177]
  - Issues: [#150][#150]

  </details>

- Added support for using the [DSC_RESOURCE_PATH environment variable][08] to define a list of
  folders to search for command-based DSC Resource manifests. When `DSC_RESOURCE_PATH` is defined,
  DSC searches those folders for resources and ignores the `PATH` variable for resource discovery.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - PRs: [#176][#176]
  - Issues: [#133][#133]

  </details>

- The `DSC/AssertionGroup`, `DSC/Group`, and `DSC/ParallelGroup` resources now define semantic exit
  codes in their manifests. These resources now indicate that they use the same
  [exit codes as the dsc command][08].

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - PRs: [#182][#182]
  - Issues: [#181][#181]

  </details>

- Added type validation in the schema for the [defaultValue][09] and [allowedValues][10] properties
  of [configuration document parameters][11] to improve the authoring experience. Now, when a
  parameter defines values for these properties that are incompatible with the defined data type,
  validation raises an error indicating that the values are invalid and why.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - PRs: [#172][#172]

  </details>

- Enhanced VS Code-specific schemas for configuration documents and resource manifests to improve
  the authoring experience. The enhanced schemas use keywords only supported by VS Code to:

  - Render Markdown help information for properties and enums.
  - Provide contextual error messages when a value fails pattern validation.
  - Define default snippets to autocomplete values.

  These schemas are non-canonical and should only be used for authoring. For more information, see
  [Authoring with enhanced schemas][12].

- Documentation to the [Microsoft/OSInfo][13] resource instance schema and command-line tool to
  provide contextual help about the properties the resource can validate.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - PRs: [#168][#168]

  </details>

### Changed

- The [$schema][14] value for configuration documents now points to the canonical published schema
  URI,
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShell/DSC/main/schemas/2023/08/config/document.json`.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - PRs: [#156][#156]

  </details>

### Fixed

- The data-type conditionals for the [configuration parameters][11] schema so that the `min*` and
  `max*` keywords apply to the correct data types. Previously, the logic prevented them from ever
  applying.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

- Using the `registry find` command no longer raises a panic error due to conflicting option
  definitions on the command.
