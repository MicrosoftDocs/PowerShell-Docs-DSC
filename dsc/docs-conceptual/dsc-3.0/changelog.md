### Added

- Implemented functionality for the [dependsOn property of resource instances][01] in configuration
  documents, enabling resource instances to depend on the successful processing of one or more
  other instances in the document.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues: [#45][#45]
  - PRs: [#175][#175]

  </details>

- Added the [export][02] property to the resource manifest schema, indicating that the resource is
  exportable and defining how DSC can retrieve the current state for every instance of the
  resource.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues: [#73][#73]
  - PRs: [#171][#171]

  </details>

- Added the [dsc config export][03] command to convert an input configuration document defining a
  list of resource types into a usable configuration document that defines the current state for
  every instance of those resources.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues: [#73][#73]
  - PRs: [#171][#171]

  </details>

- Added the [dsc resource export][04] command to generate a usable configuration document that
  defines the current state for every instance of a specified resource.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues: [#73][#73]
  - PRs: [#171][#171]

  </details>

- Added the [--all][05] option for the [dsc resource get][06] command, enabling users to retrieve
  the current state for every instance of an exportable resource with a single command.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - Issues:
    - [#73][#73]
    - [#174][#174]
  - PRs: [#171][#171]

  </details>

- Added handling for the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> key combination to cancel a DSC operation.
  When `dsc` cancels an operation due to this key-press, it indicates that the operation was
  cancelled with [exit code 6][07].

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - PRs: [#177][#177]
  - Issues: [#150][#150]

  </details>

- Added support for using the [DSC_RESOURCE_PATH environment variable][08] to define a list of
  folders to search for command-based DSC Resource manifests. When `DSC_RESOURCE_PATH` is defined,
  DSC searches those folders for resources and ignores the `PATH` variable for resource discovery.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - PRs: [#176][#176]
  - Issues: [#133][#133]

  </details>

- The `DSC/AssertionGroup`, `DSC/Group`, and `DSC/ParallelGroup` resources now define semantic exit
  codes in their manifests. These resources now indicate that they use the same
  [exit codes as the dsc command][08].

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - PRs: [#182][#182]
  - Issues: [#181][#181]

  </details>

- Added type validation in the schema for the [defaultValue][09] and [allowedValues][10] properties
  of [configuration document parameters][11] to improve the authoring experience. Now, when a
  parameter defines values for these properties that are incompatible with the defined data type,
  validation raises an error indicating that the values are invalid and why.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - PRs: [#172][#172]

  </details>

- Enhanced VS Code-specific schemas for configuration documents and resource manifests to improve
  the authoring experience. The enhanced schemas use keywords only supported by VS Code to:

  - Render Markdown help information for properties and enums.
  - Provide contextual error messages when a value fails pattern validation.
  - Define default snippets to autocomplete values.

  These schemas are non-canonical and should only be used for authoring. For more information, see
  [Authoring with enhanced schemas][12].

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - PRs: [#172][#172]

  </details>

- Documentation to the [Microsoft/OSInfo][13] resource instance schema and command-line tool to
  provide contextual help about the properties the resource can validate.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - PRs: [#168][#168]

  </details>

### Changed

- The [$schema][14] value for configuration documents now points to the canonical published schema
  URI,
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShell/DSC/main/schemas/2023/08/config/document.json`.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - PRs: [#156][#156]

  </details>

### Fixed

- The data-type conditionals for the [configuration parameters][11] schema so that the `min*` and
  `max*` keywords apply to the correct data types. Previously, the logic prevented them from ever
  applying.

  <details><summary>Related work items</summary>

  - PRs: [#172][#172]

  </details>

- Using the `registry find` command no longer raises a panic error due to conflicting option
  definitions on the command.
