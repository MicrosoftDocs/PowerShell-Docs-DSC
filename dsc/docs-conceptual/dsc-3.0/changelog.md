    Helpful docs snippets

    You can use the following snippets in this file to make authoring new change entries and
    releases easier.

    docs-changelog-entry-single-issue-pr: Adds a new changelog list entry with one related issue
    and PR. Use this when a change entry only has one related issue and/or pull request. Always
    use this snippet under a change kind heading, like 'Added' or 'Changed.'

    docs-changelog-entry-multi-issue-pr: Adds a new changelog list entry with sub-lists for issues
    and PRs. Use this when a change entry has more than one related issue and/or pull request.
    Always use this snippet under a change kind heading, like 'Added' or 'Changed.'

    docs-changelog-release-heading: Adds a new changelog release heading, following our existing
    format. Use this when a new release is created to ensure that the new release heading has the
    required links and synopsis.

    docs-gh-link: Adds a new link to an issue or pull request on GitHub. Use this when adding a new
    work item link reference and it will automatically construct the URL and reference link ID for
    you from the work item ID.

All notable changes to DSC after the `3.0.0` release are documented in this file. The format is
based on [Keep a Changelog][m1], and DSC adheres to [Semantic Versioning][m2].

To see the changes for the earlier development of DSC before version `3.0.0`, see the
[DSC prerelease changelog][m3] on GitHub.

    Unreleased change entry instructions:

    Add entries between releases under the appropriate section heading here. When you need to add
    a change, make sure it's under one of the H3s, not this H2. Use one of the following snippets
    to add the change entry:

    - docs-changelog-entry-single-issue-pr: Adds a new changelog list entry with one related issue
      and PR. Use this when a change entry only has one related issue and/or pull request.

    - docs-changelog-entry-multi-issue-pr: Adds a new changelog list entry with sub-lists for
      issues and PRs. Use this when a change entry has more than one related issue and/or pull
      request.

    When you're ready to update the unreleased changelog entries for a new release, use the
    docs-changelog-release-heading snippet to create the new release heading after this comment and
    before the first H3 for the changes.

    After doing so, rename the unreleased reference links from `ur-##` to `<prefix>-##`, where
    <prefix> is a two-character prefix for the release. For alpha releases, we use `a#`, like `a5`
    for the `v3.0.0.0-alpha.5` release. Leave the release links under the release section.
