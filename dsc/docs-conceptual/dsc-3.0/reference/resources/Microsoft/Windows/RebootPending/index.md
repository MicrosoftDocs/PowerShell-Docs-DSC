# Microsoft.Windows/RebootPending

## Synopsis

Checks if a Windows system has a pending reboot.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `Microsoft.Windows/RebootPending` resource are a proof-of-concept example for use with DSC.
> Don't use it in production.

## Metadata

```yaml
Version    : 0.1.0
Kind       : resource
Tags       : [Windows]
Author     : Microsoft
```

## Instance definition syntax

```yaml
resources:
  - name: <instance name>
    type: Microsoft.Windows/RebootPending
    properties: {}
```

## Description

The `Microsoft.Windows/RebootPending` resource enables you to check whether a Windows system has a
pending reboot. The resource can determine if a system reboot is required due to:

- Windows Updates
- Component-Based Servicing
- Pending file rename operations
- Pending computer rename
- Pending domain join operations

> [!NOTE]
> This resource is installed with DSC itself on Windows systems.
>
> You can update this resource by updating DSC. When you update DSC, the updated version of this
> resource is automatically available.

## Requirements

- The resource is only usable on a Windows system.
- The resource must run in a process context that has permissions to query the system for reboot
  status.

## Capabilities

The resource has the following capabilities:

- `get` - You can use the resource to retrieve the pending reboot status of a system.

This resource doesn't implement the **Set**, **WhatIf**, **Export**, **Delete**, or **Test**
capabilities. You can't use this resource to enforce or export configurations.

Note that even though this resource doesn't implement **Test**, you can still invoke the test
operation against this resource. This resource relies on the synthetic testing provided by DSC.

For more information about resource capabilities, see [DSC resource capabilities][02].

## Examples

1. [Check for pending reboot][04] - Shows how to check if a system has a pending reboot using the
   `dsc resource get` command.
2. [Use the RebootPending resource in a configuration][05] - Shows how to include the RebootPending
   resource in a configuration document to check reboot status.

## Properties

The resource doesn't have any configurable properties. It's a read-only resource designed to detect
a system's reboot status.

- **Read-only properties:** <a id="read-only-properties"></a> The resource returns the following
  properties. For more information about read-only properties, see the "Read-only resource
  properties" section in [DSC resource properties][03].

  - [rebootPending](#rebootpending) - Indicates whether the system has a pending reboot.

### rebootPending

<details><summary>Expand for <code>rebootPending</code> property metadata</summary>

```yaml
Type         : boolean
IsRequired   : false
IsKey        : false
IsReadOnly   : true
IsWriteOnly  : false
```

</details>

A boolean value that indicates whether the system has a pending reboot. This property is `true` if
a reboot is pending and otherwise `false`.

### Reason

<details><summary>Expand for <code>reason</code> property metadata</summary>

```yaml
Type         : array, null
IsRequired   : false
IsKey        : false
IsReadOnly   : true
IsWriteOnly  : false
```

</details>

An array of strings that provides detailed information about why a reboot is pending, or `null` if
no reboot is pending. When a reboot is required, this property contains specific reasons such as:

- Windows Updates requiring restart
- Component-Based Servicing operations
- Pending file rename operations
- Computer rename pending
- Domain join operations pending

## Instance validating schema

The following snippet contains the JSON Schema that validates an instance of the resource.

```json
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "rebootPending": {
            "type": "boolean",
            "readOnly": true
        },
        "reasons": {
            "type": [
                "array",
                "null"
            ],
            "readOnly": true
        }
    }
}
```

## Exit codes

The resource returns the following exit codes from operations:

- [0](#exit-code-0) - Success
- [1](#exit-code-1) - Error

### Exit code 0

Indicates the resource operation completed without errors.

### Exit code 1

Indicates the resource operation failed.
