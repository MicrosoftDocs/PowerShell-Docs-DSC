# DSC Resource manifest get property schema reference

## Synopsis

Defines how to retrieve a DSC Resource instance.

## Metadata

```yaml
SchemaDialect: https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema
SchemaID:      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShell/DSC/main/schemas/2023/08/resource/manifest.get.json
Type:          object
```

## Description

Every command-based DSC Resource must define the `get` property in its manifest. This property
defines how DSC can get the current state of a resource instance.

## Examples

### Example 1 - Minimal definition

This example is from the `Microsoft/OSInfo` DSC Resource.

```json
"get": {
  "executable": "osinfo"
}
```

It only defines the `executable` property. When a manifest doesn't define `args`, DSC passes no
arguments to the command. When a manifest doesn't define `input`, the default behavior is to send a
JSON blob to the command over `stdin`.

With this definition, DSC calls the `get` method for this resource by running:

```sh
{ ... } | osinfo
```

### Example 2 - Full definition

This example is from the `Microsoft.Windows/Registry` DSC Resource.

```json
"get": {
  "executable": "registry",
  "args": [
    "config",
    "get"
  ],
  "input": "stdin"
}
```

It defines `executable` as `registry`, rather than `registry.exe`. The extension isn't required
when the operating system recognizes the command as an executable. The manifest defines two
arguments, `config` and `get`. The `input` property indicates that the `get` command expects its
input as a JSON blob from `stdin`. Combined with the value for `executable`, DSC calls the get
method for this resource by running:

```sh
{ ... } | registry config get
```

## Required Properties

The `get` definition must include these properties:

- [executable](#executable)

## Properties

### executable

The `executable` property defines the name of the command to run. The value must be the name of a
command discoverable in the system's `PATH` environment variable or the full path to the command. A
file extension is only required when the command isn't recognizable by the operating system as an
executable.

```yaml
Type:     string
Required: true
```

### args

The `args` property defines an array of strings to pass as arguments to the command. DSC passes the
arguments to the command in the order they're specified.

```yaml
Type:     array
Required: false
Default:  []
```

### input

The `input` property defines how to pass input to the resource. The value of this property must
be one of the following strings:

- `args` - Indicates that the resource expects the properties of an instance to be specified with
  command line arguments. This option isn't implemented yet.
- `stdin` - Indicates that the resource expects a JSON blob representing an instance from `stdin`.

```yaml
Type:        string
Required:    false
Default:     stdin
ValidValues: [args, stdin]
```
