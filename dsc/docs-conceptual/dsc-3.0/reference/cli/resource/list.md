# dsc resource list

## Synopsis

Retrieves the list of available DSC Resources with an optional filter.

## Syntax

```sh
dsc resource list [Options] <RESOURCE_NAME>
```

## Description

The `list` subcommand searches for available DSC Resources and returns their information. DSC
discovers resources by first searching the `PATH` or `DSC_RESOURCE_PATH` environment variable for
`.dsc.resource.json`, `.dsc.resource.yml`, and `dsc.resource.yaml` files. For more information
about the environment variables DSC uses, see [Environment variables][01]

If any of the discovered resources are resource adapters, DSC calls the `list` operation for those
adapters if the [--adapter](#--adapter) option specifies a matching filter. By default, DSC doesn't
return any adapted resources. When you use the `--adapter` option, the command doesn't return any
non-adapted resources.

DSC returns the list of discovered resources with their implementation information and metadata. If
the command includes the `RESOURCE_NAME` argument, DSC filters the list of discovered resources
before returning them. The `--description` and `--tags` options filter the results by the resource
descriptions and tags. Filters are always applied after resource discovery.

### Adapted resource cache

DSC maintains a cache of discovered adapted resources for performance optimization. The location of
the cache depends on the operating system, as shown in the following table.

| Operating system | Cache path                                            |
|:----------------:|:------------------------------------------------------|
|      Linux       | `~/.dsc/AdaptedResourcesLookupTable.json`             |
|      macOS       | `~/.dsc/AdaptedResourcesLookupTable.json`             |
|     Windows      | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\dsc\AdaptedResourcesLookupTable.json` |

## Examples

### Example 1 - List all non-adapted resources

Without any filters, the command returns every discovered DSC Resource, but doesn't call the `list`
operation for adapter resources to enumerate any adapted resources.

```sh
dsc resource list
```

```Output

```

### Example 2 - List a specific resource

When the `RESOURCE_NAME` argument doesn't include a wildcard, the command returns only the resource
with the specified type name.

```sh
dsc resource list Microsoft.DSC/Group
```

```Output
Type                 Kind   Version  Capabilities  RequireAdapter  Description
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Microsoft.DSC/Group  Group  0.1.0    gs--t---                      All resources in the supplied configuration is treated as a group.
```

### Example 3 - List resources with a matching type name

When the `RESOURCE_NAME` argument includes a wildcard, the command returns every resource with a
matching type name.

```sh
dsc resource list Microsoft.DSC/*
```

```Output
Type                      Kind      Version  Capabilities  RequireAdapter  Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Microsoft.DSC/Assertion   Group     0.1.0    gs--t---                      `test` will be invoked for all resources in the supplied configuration.
Microsoft.DSC/Group       Group     0.1.0    gs--t---                      All resources in the supplied configuration is treated as a group.
Microsoft.DSC/Include     Importer  0.1.0    gs--t---                      Allows including a configuration file with optional parameter file.
Microsoft.DSC/PowerShell  Adapter   0.1.0    gs--t-e-                      Resource adapter to classic DSC Powershell resources.
```

### Example 4 - List resources with a matching description

When the command includes the *`--description` option, the results include resources that have a
description containing the specified value.

```sh
dsc resource list --description 'supplied configuration'
```

```Output
Type                     Kind   Version  Capabilities  RequireAdapter  Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Microsoft.DSC/Assertion  Group  0.1.0    gs--t---                      `test` will be invoked for all resources in the supplied configuration.
Microsoft.DSC/Group      Group  0.1.0    gs--t---                      All resources in the supplied configuration is treated as a group.
```

### Example 5 - List resources with matching tags

When the command includes multiple instances of the `--tags` option, the results include resources
that have any of the specified tags.

```sh
dsc resource list --tags Windows --tags Linux
```

```output
Type                        Kind      Version  Capabilities  RequireAdapter  Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Microsoft.Windows/Registry  Resource  0.1.0    gs-w-d--                      Manage Windows Registry keys and values
Microsoft/OSInfo            Resource  0.1.0    g-----e-                      Returns information about the operating system.
```

### Example 6 - List resources for a specific adapter

When the command includes the `--adapter` option, DSC checks for any discovered resource adapters
with a matching name. If it discovers any, it then calls the `list` operation for the adapter and
adds the returned list of adapted resources to the discovered resource list. DSC applies any
further filters specified with the command after this enumeration.

```sh
dsc resource list --adapter Microsoft.Windows/WindowsPowerShell
```

This next command specifies the resource name filter `*Windows*`, limiting the list of returned
resources:

```sh
dsc resource list --adapter Microsoft.Windows/WindowsPowerShell *Windows*
```

## Arguments

### RESOURCE_NAME

Specifies an optional filter to apply for the type names of discovered DSC Resources. The filter
can include wildcards (`*`). The filter isn't case-sensitive.

When this argument is specified, DSC filters the results to include only resources where the
resource type name matches the filter.

For example, specifying the filter `Microsoft.*` returns only the resources published by Microsoft.
Specifying the filter `*Sql*` returns any resource with the string `Sql` in its name, regardless of
the casing.

```yaml
Type      : string
Mandatory : false
```

## Options

### -a, --adapter

<a id="-a"></a>
<a id="--adapter"></a>

Specifies a filter to define which adapter resources to enumerate adapted resources for. By
default, the command doesn't call the `list` command for adapter resources. When you specify this
option, DSC looks for adapter resources with type names that match the filter. If it discovers any
adapters matching the filter, it calls the `list` command for those adapters and returns the
adapted resources. DSC retrieves adapted resources before applying any other filters for the
command.

When you use this option, the command doesn't return any non-adapted resources.

If you specify this option with the filter `*`, DSC calls `list` for every adapter resource it
finds before applying the other filters.

```yaml
Type        : string
Mandatory   : false
LongSyntax  : --adapter <ADAPTER_NAME>
ShortSyntax : -a <ADAPTER_NAME>
```

### -d, --description

<a id="-d"></a>
<a id="--description"></a>

Specifies a string to match in a resource's description. When this option is specified, DSC filters
the resources by their description strings. The filter is case-insensitive and matches the value
anywhere in the description string. Wildcards aren't permitted.

```yaml
Type        : string
Mandatory   : false
LongSyntax  : --description <DESCRIPTION>
ShortSyntax : -d <DESCRIPTION>
```

### -t, --tags

<a id="-t"></a>
<a id="--tags"></a>

Specifies a resource tag to filter on. When this option is specified, DSC filters the resources and
only includes those with a matching tag. The filter is case-insensitive. Wildcards aren't permitted.

You can specify this option more than once to filter on a set of tags. The results include
resources that have at least one of the tags specified with this option.

```yaml
Type        : string
Mandatory   : false
LongSyntax  : --tags <TAGS>
ShortSyntax : -t <TAGS>
```

### -o, --output-format

<a id="-o"></a>
<a id="--output-format"></a>

The `--output-format` option controls which format DSC uses for the data the command returns. The
available formats are:

- `json` to emit the data as a [JSON Line][02].
- `pretty-json` to emit the data as JSON with newlines, indentation, and spaces for readability.
- `yaml` to emit the data as YAML.

The default output format depends on whether DSC detects that the output is being redirected or
captured as a variable:

- If the command isn't being redirected or captured, DSC displays the output as a summary table
  described in the [Output](#output) section of this document.
- If the command output is redirected or captured, DSC emits the data as the `json` format to
  stdout.

When you use this option, DSC uses the specified format regardless of whether the command is being
redirected or captured.

When the command isn't redirected or captured, the output in the console is formatted for improved
readability. When the command isn't redirected or captured, the output include terminal sequences
for formatting.

```yaml
Type        : string
Mandatory   : false
ValidValues : [json, pretty-json, yaml]
LongSyntax  : --output-format <OUTPUT_FORMAT>
ShortSyntax : -o <OUTPUT_FORMAT>
```

### -h, --help

<a id="-h"></a>
<a id="--help"></a>

Displays the help for the current command or subcommand. When you specify this option, the
application ignores all other options and arguments.

```yaml
Type        : boolean
Mandatory   : false
LongSyntax  : --help
ShortSyntax : -h
```

## Output

This command returns a formatted array containing an object for each resource that includes the
resource's type, version, manifest settings, and other metadata. For more information, see
[dsc resource list result schema][03].

If the output of the command isn't captured or redirected, it displays in the console by default as
a summary table for the returned resources. The summary table includes the following columns,
displayed in the listed order:

- **Type** - The fully qualified type name of the resource.
- **Kind** - Whether the resource is an `adapter`, `group`, `importer`, or typical `Resource`. For
  more information, see [DSC Resource kind schema reference][04].
- **Version** - The semantic version of the resource.
- **Capabilities** - A display of the resource's [capabilities][05] as flags. The capabilities are
  displayed in the following order, using a `-` instead of the appropriate letter if the resource
  doesn't have a specific capability:

  - `g` indicates that the resource has the [get capability][06].
  - `s` indicates that the resource has the [set capability][07]
  - `x` indicates that the resource has the [setHandlesExist capability][08]
  - `w` indicates that the resource has the [whatIf capability][09]
  - `t` indicates that the resource has the [test capability][10]
  - `d` indicates that the resource has the [delete capability][11]
  - `e` indicates that the resource has the [export capability][12]
  - `r` indicates that the resource has the [resolve capability][13]

  For example, the `Microsoft.Windows/Registry` resource has the following capabilities: `gs--d-`,
  indicating it has the `get`, `set`, and `delete` capabilities.
- **RequireAdapter** - The fully qualified type name of the adapter resource that DSC uses to
  invoke the returned resource.
- **Description** - The short description of the resource's purpose and usage.

For more information about the formatting of the output data, see the
[--output-format option](#--output-format).
