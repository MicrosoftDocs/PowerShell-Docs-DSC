# Write your first DSC Resource tutorial overview

Each of the tutorials in this section implements the same DSC Resource in a different language.

The DSC Resources manage the fictional [TSToy application][01]'s configuration files. While the
TSToy application isn't a real production application, managing configuration files is a common
use-case for DSC Resources.

In these tutorials, you learn how to:

- Create a DSC Resource in your preferred programming language.
- Define the properties of the resource.
- Implement get and set commands for the resource.
- Write a manifest for the resource.
- Manually test the resource.

The tutorials are hosted in the [DSC Samples repository site][02]. The sample code for the end of
each tutorial is hosted in the [DSC Samples repository][03].

We welcome contributions to the samples repository. For more information, see
[Contributing to the DSC Samples][04].
