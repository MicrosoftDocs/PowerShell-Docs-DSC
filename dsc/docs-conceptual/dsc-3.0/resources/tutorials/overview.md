# DSC Resource tutorials overview

Each of the tutorials in this section covers a different aspect of implementing a DSC Resource.
Each tutorial is implemented in at least one programming language. The tutorial implementations
teach the same concepts and the DSC Resource they create has the same functionality across the
language implementations.

The DSC Resources manage the fictional [TSToy application][01]'s configuration files. While the
TSToy application isn't a real production application, managing configuration files is a common
use-case for DSC Resources.

The tutorials are hosted in the [DSC Samples repository site][02]. The sample code for the end of
each tutorial is hosted in the [DSC Samples repository][03].

We welcome contributions to the samples repository. For more information, see
[Contributing to the DSC Samples][04].
