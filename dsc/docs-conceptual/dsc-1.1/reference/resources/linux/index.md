# DSC for Linux Resources

DSC for Linux is no longer supported. The [PowerShell DSC for Linux project][01] was deprecated and
archived on 12 September 2024. On 30 September 2023, Microsoft retired the desired state
configuration (DSC) extension for Linux virtual machines and support for Linux machines in Azure
Automation DSC. The [OMI project][02] has been deprecated since 24 March 2025.

You can continue to use PowerShell DSC resources on Linux through the following tools:

- [Azure machine configuration][03]
- [Microsoft desired state configuration][04]

You can continue to use updated versions of the resources previously provided by PowerShell DSC for
Linux with the [nxtools module][05], which is [available on the PowerShell Gallery][06].
