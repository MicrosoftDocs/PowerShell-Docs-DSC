# Desired State Configuration Pull Service

Local Configuration Manager (LCM) can be centrally managed by a Pull Service solution. When using
this approach, the node that's being managed is registered with a service and assigned a
configuration in LCM settings. The configuration and all DSC resources needed as dependencies for
the configuration are downloaded to the machine and used by LCM to manage the configuration.
Information about the state of the machine being managed is uploaded to the service for reporting.
This concept is referred to as "pull service".

The current options for pull service include:

- Azure Automation Desired State Configuration service
- A pull service running on Windows Server
- Community maintained open-source solutions
- An SMB share

The recommended scale for each solution is as follows:

|                   Solution                   |              Client nodes              |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Windows Pull Server using MDB/ESENT database | Up to 500 nodes                        |
| Windows Pull Server using SQL database       | Up to 3500 nodes                       |
| Azure Automation DSC                         | Both small and large environments      |

**The recommended solution**, and the option with the most features available, is
[Azure Automation DSC][04]. An upper limit for number of nodes per Automation Account hasn't been
identified.

The Azure service can manage nodes on-premises in private datacenters, or in public clouds such as
Azure and AWS. For private environments where servers can't directly connect to the Internet,
consider limiting outbound traffic to only the published Azure IP range (see
[Azure IP Ranges and Service Tags][19]).

Features of the online service that aren't currently available in the pull service on Windows
Server include:

- All data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Client certificates are created and managed automatically
- Secrets store for centrally managing [passwords/credentials][05], or [variables][06] such as
  server names or connection strings
- Centrally manage node [LCM configuration][01]
- Centrally assign configurations to client nodes
- Release configuration changes to "canary groups" for testing before reaching production
- Graphical reporting
  - Status detail at the DSC resource level of granularity
  - Verbose error messages from client machines for troubleshooting
- [Integration with Azure Log Analytics][03] for alerting,
  automated tasks, Android/iOS app for reporting and alerting

## DSC pull service in Windows Server

It's possible to configure a pull service to run on Windows Server. Be advised that the pull service
solution included in Windows Server includes only capabilities of storing configurations and modules
for download and capturing report data into a database. It doesn't include many of the capabilities
offered by the service in Azure and so, isn't a good tool for evaluating how the service would be
used.

The pull service offered in Windows Server is a web service in IIS that uses an OData interface to
make DSC configuration files available to target nodes when those nodes ask for them.

Requirements for using a pull server:

- A server running:
  - WMF/PowerShell 4.0 or greater
  - IIS server role
  - DSC Service
- Ideally, some means of generating a certificate, to secure credentials passed to the Local
  Configuration Manager (LCM) on target nodes

The best way to configure Windows Server to host pull service is to use a DSC configuration. An
example script is provided below.

### Supported database systems

Starting in release 17090 of Windows Server, WMF 5.1 includes support for the SQL Server option for
the Pull Service (Windows Feature *DSC-Service*). This provides a new option for scaling large DSC
environments that haven't migrated to [Azure Automation DSC][04].

To configure the pull server to use SQL Server, set **SqlProvider** to `$true` and
**SqlConnectionString** to a valid SQL Server Connection String. For more information, see
[SqlClient Connection Strings][09]. For an example of SQL Server configuration with
**xDscWebService**, first read [Using the xDscWebService resource][12] and then review
[2-xDscWebService_RegistrationUseSQLProvider_Config.ps1][14] on GitHub.

### Using the xDscWebService resource

The easiest way to set up a web pull server is to use the **xDscWebService** resource, included in
the **xPSDesiredStateConfiguration** module. The following steps explain how to use the resource in
a `Configuration` that sets up the web service.

1. Call the [Install-Module][10] cmdlet to install the **xPSDesiredStateConfiguration** module.
1. Get an SSL certificate for the DSC Pull server from a trusted Certificate Authority, either
   within your organization or a public authority. The certificate received from the authority is
   usually in the PFX format.
1. Install the certificate on the node that will become the DSC Pull server in the default location,
   which should be `CERT:\LocalMachine\My`. Make a note of the certificate thumbprint.
1. Select a GUID to be used as the Registration Key. To generate one using PowerShell enter the
   following at the PS prompt and press enter: `[guid]::newGuid()` or `New-Guid`. This key will be
   used by client nodes as a shared key to authenticate during registration. For more information,
   see the Registration Key section below.
1. In the PowerShell ISE, start (<kbd>F5</kbd>) the following configuration script (included in the
   folder of the **xPSDesiredStateConfiguration** module as `Sample_xDscWebServiceRegistration.ps1`.

   This script sets up the pull server.

    ```powershell
    configuration Sample_xDscWebServiceRegistration
    {
        param
        (
            [string[]]$NodeName = 'localhost',

            [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
            [string] $certificateThumbPrint,

            [Parameter(HelpMessage='This should be a string with enough entropy (randomness)' +
                ' to protect the registration of clients to the pull server.  We will use new' +
                ' GUID by default.'
            )]
            [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
            [string] $RegistrationKey   # A guid that clients use to initiate conversation with pull server
        )

        Import-DSCResource -ModuleName PSDesiredStateConfiguration
        Import-DSCResource -ModuleName xPSDesiredStateConfiguration

        Node $NodeName
        {
            WindowsFeature DSCServiceFeature
            {
                Ensure = "Present"
                Name   = "DSC-Service"
            }

            xDscWebService PSDSCPullServer
            {
                Ensure                  = "Present"
                EndpointName            = "PSDSCPullServer"
                Port                    = 8080
                PhysicalPath            = "$env:SystemDrive\inetpub\PSDSCPullServer"
                CertificateThumbPrint   = $certificateThumbPrint
                ModulePath              = "$env:PROGRAMFILES\WindowsPowerShell\DscService\Modules"
                ConfigurationPath       = "$env:PROGRAMFILES\WindowsPowerShell\DscService\Configuration"
                State                   = "Started"
                DependsOn               = "[WindowsFeature]DSCServiceFeature"
                RegistrationKeyPath     = "$env:PROGRAMFILES\WindowsPowerShell\DscService"
                AcceptSelfSignedCertificates = $true
                UseSecurityBestPractices     = $true
                Enable32BitAppOnWin64   = $false
            }

            File RegistrationKeyFile
            {
                Ensure          = 'Present'
                Type            = 'File'
                DestinationPath = "$env:ProgramFiles\WindowsPowerShell\DscService\RegistrationKeys.txt"
                Contents        = $RegistrationKey
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. Run the configuration, passing the thumbprint of the SSL certificate as the
   **certificateThumbPrint** parameter and a GUID registration key as the **RegistrationKey**
   parameter:

   ```powershell
   # To find the Thumbprint for an installed SSL certificate for use with the pull server list all
   # certificates in your local store and then copy the thumbprint for the appropriate certificate
   # by     reviewing the certificate subjects

   dir Cert:\LocalMachine\my

   # Then include this thumbprint when running the configuration
   $sample_xDscWebServiceRegistrationSplat = @{
       certificateThumbprint = 'A7000024B753FA6FFF88E966FD6E19301FAE9CCC'
       RegistrationKey = '140a952b-b9d6-406b-b416-e0f759c9c0e4'
       OutputPath = 'C:\Configs\PullServer'
   }
   Sample_xDscWebServiceRegistration @sample_xDscWebServiceRegistrationSplat

   # Run the compiled configuration to make the target node a DSC Pull Server
   Start-DscConfiguration -Path c:\Configs\PullServer -Wait -Verbose
   ```

#### Registration Key

To allow client nodes to register with the server so that they can use configuration names instead
of a configuration ID, a registration key that was created by the above configuration is saved in a
file named `RegistrationKeys.txt` in `C:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\DscService`. The
registration key functions as a shared secret used during the initial registration by the client
with the pull server. The client will generate a self-signed certificate that's used to uniquely
authenticate to the pull server once registration is successfully completed. The thumbprint of this
certificate is stored locally and associated with the URL of the pull server.

> [!NOTE]
> Registration keys aren't supported in PowerShell 4.0.

In order to configure a node to authenticate with the pull server, the registration key needs to be
in the metaconfiguration for any target node that will be registering with this pull server. Note
that the **RegistrationKey** in the metaconfiguration below is removed after the target machine has
successfully registered, and that the value must match the value stored in the
`RegistrationKeys.txt` file on the pull server ('140a952b-b9d6-406b-b416-e0f759c9c0e4' for this
example). Always treat the registration key value securely, because knowing it allows any target
machine to register with the pull server.

```powershell
[DSCLocalConfigurationManager()]
configuration Sample_MetaConfigurationToRegisterWithLessSecurePullServer
{
    param
    (
        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
        [string] $NodeName = 'localhost',

        # the key used to set up pull server in previous configuration
        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
        [string] $RegistrationKey,

        # The name of the pull server, same as $NodeName used in previous configuration
        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]
        [string] $ServerName = 'localhost'
    )

    Node $NodeName
    {
        Settings
        {
            RefreshMode        = 'Pull'
        }

        ConfigurationRepositoryWeb CONTOSO-PullSrv
        {
            ServerURL          = "https://$ServerName`:8080/PSDSCPullServer.svc"
            RegistrationKey    = $RegistrationKey
            ConfigurationNames = @('ClientConfig')
        }

        ReportServerWeb CONTOSO-PullSrv
        {
            ServerURL       = "https://$ServerName`:8080/PSDSCPullServer.svc"
            RegistrationKey = $RegistrationKey
        }
    }
}

$MetaConfigurationSplat = @{
    RegistrationKey = $RegistrationKey
    OutputPath = 'c:\Configs\TargetNodes'
}

Sample_MetaConfigurationToRegisterWithLessSecurePullServer @MetaConfigurationSplat
```

> [!NOTE]
> The **ReportServerWeb** section allows reporting data to be sent to the pull server.

The lack of the **ConfigurationID** property in the metaconfiguration file implicitly means that
pull server is supporting the V2 version of the pull server protocol so an initial registration is
required. Conversely, the presence of a **ConfigurationID** means that the V1 version of the pull
server protocol is used and there is no registration processing.

> [!NOTE]
> In a PUSH scenario, a bug exists in the current release that makes it necessary to define
> a ConfigurationID property in the metaconfiguration file for nodes that have never registered with
> a pull server. This will force the V1 Pull Server protocol and avoid registration failure
> messages.

## Placing configurations and resources

After the pull server setup completes, the folders defined by the **ConfigurationPath** and
**ModulePath** properties in the pull server configuration are where you will place modules and
configurations that will be available for target nodes to pull. These files need to be in a specific
format in order for the pull server to correctly process them.

### DSC resource module package format

Each resource module needs to be zipped and named according to the following pattern
`<Module Name>_<Module Version>.zip`.

For example, a module named **xWebAdminstration** with a module version of 3.1.2.0 would be named
`xWebAdministration_3.1.2.0.zip`. Each version of a module must be contained in a single zip file.
Since there is only a single version of a resource in each zip file, the module format added in WMF
5.0 with support for multiple module versions in a single directory isn't supported. This means that
before packaging up DSC resource modules for use with pull server you will need to make a small
change to the directory structure. The default format of modules containing DSC resource in WMF 5.0
is `<Module Folder>\<Module Version>\DscResources\<DSC Resource Folder>\`. Before packaging up for
the pull server, remove the `<Module version>` folder so the path becomes
`<Module Folder>\DscResources\<DSC Resource Folder>\`. With this change, zip the folder as described
above and place these zip files in the **ModulePath** folder.

Use `New-DscChecksum <module zip file>` to create a checksum file for the newly added module.

### Configuration MOF format

A configuration MOF file needs to be paired with a checksum file so that an LCM on a target node can
validate the configuration. To create a checksum, call the [New-DscChecksum][11] cmdlet. The cmdlet
takes a **Path** parameter that specifies the folder where the configuration MOF is located. The
cmdlet creates a checksum file named `ConfigurationMOFName.mof.checksum`, where
`ConfigurationMOFName` is the name of the configuration mof file. If there are more than one
configuration MOF files in the specified folder, a checksum is created for each configuration in the
folder. Place the MOF files and their associated checksum files in the **ConfigurationPath** folder.

> [!NOTE]
> If you change the configuration MOF file in any way, you must also recreate the checksum file.

### Tooling

To set up, validate, and manage the pull server, use the following tools included as examples in the
latest version of the xPSDesiredStateConfiguration module:

1. A module that will help with packaging DSC resource modules and configuration files for use on
   the pull server. [PublishModulesAndMofsToPullServer.psm1][15]. Examples below:

    ```powershell
    # Example 1 - Package all versions of given modules installed locally and
    # MOF files are in c:\LocalDepot
    $moduleList = @('xWebAdministration', 'xPhp')
    Publish-DSCModuleAndMof -Source C:\LocalDepot -ModuleNameList $moduleList

    # Example 2 - Package modules and mof documents from c:\LocalDepot
    Publish-DSCModuleAndMof -Source C:\LocalDepot -Force
    ```

1. A script that validates the pull server is configured correctly.
   [PullServerSetupTests.ps1][16].

## Community Solutions for Pull Service

The DSC community has authored multiple solutions to implement the pull service protocol. For
on-premises environments, these offer pull service capabilities and an opportunity to contribute
back to the community with incremental enhancements.
